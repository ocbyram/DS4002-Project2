## Section 3: Reproducing

Before starting ensure that you have all the required software installed as outlined in [Section 1](#section-1:-software-and-platform). We also
encourage use of either Mac, Windows or Ubuntu, as that is what the analysis was tested on, although other operating systems may work. 


***In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.***
