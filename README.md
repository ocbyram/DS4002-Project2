## Section 3: Reproducing

***In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.*** 


Before starting ensure that you have all the required software installed as outlined in Section 1. We also encourage use of either Mac, Windows or Ubuntu, as that is what the analysis was tested on, although other operating systems may work.

### R scripts

### Python scripts
1. In the SCRIPTS directory, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages
2. Open analysis.ipynb in VS Code
3. Pres the run all button at the top of the notebook to run the analysis 




You can analyze these results in your own way, or look through our presentation to see the conclusions that we drew.
